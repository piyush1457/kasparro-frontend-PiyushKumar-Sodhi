# Kasparro – AI Brand Visibility Audit Platform

## Overview

Kasparro is a frontend prototype of a SaaS platform that helps brands understand how they appear inside **AI-generated answers**.

As users increasingly rely on tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude instead of traditional search engines, brand visibility is no longer limited to Google rankings. Kasparro represents an **AI-first approach to brand visibility and SEO intelligence**.

This project focuses on product design, frontend architecture, and UX — not real AI model integration.

## Problem Statement

Traditional SEO tools answer questions like:
- What keywords do I rank for?
- How much traffic do I get from search engines?

Kasparro answers:
- Does AI recommend my brand?
- What sentiment is associated with my brand in AI responses?
- How visible is my brand compared to competitors in AI-generated answers?
- How strong is my brand’s EEAT profile from an AI perspective?
